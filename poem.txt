What the Roses did you just say about me, you little Violet?
I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Florists,
and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Home Depot,
and I have over 300 confirmed flower beds.

Roses are violets.
Violets are orange.
Github is beautiful
I like turtles
Github is cool
And so are you.

this is a poem.
